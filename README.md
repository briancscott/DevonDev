Dev sample for Devon

Howdy folks,

I hope all is well. Since I hadn't heard from you and I was told the interview process was ongoing, I figured I would take the initiative to start coding something to somewhat demonstrate my abilities. Welcome to DevonDev, The Devon Developer Development Portal SPA thingy.

Yes, this solution is derived from an MVC template (provided within VS 2017 Community - my MSDN subscription belonged to Johnson Controls, as does essentially all the code I've written since 2010), but my code itself is original - no plagiarism here whatsoever. I've created some original controllers and viewmodels, a few tables and a couple stored procedures, and made some tweaks to the view. The solution itself is a work in progress and it will evolve accordingly as I make and find time to work on it. There is much yet to do, but feel free to watch me work, and please don't hesitate to request/suggest any functionality you would like to see or let me know if you encounter any build issues, etc. I welcome any challenge you would like to send my way. I'm also new to Git after languishing exclusively in TFS land for source control, but I'm making heads or tails of it. So far, so good.

I sincerely hope to hear from you guys soon. Unemployment is not fun, and your building is really, really cool. Call me. Thanks.
